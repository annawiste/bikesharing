# NYC Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview
This analysis uses data from one month of rides with a bikesharing service in New York City to provide insight which may be helpful in the design of a similar service in another location. The focus is on when and for how long users tend to use the bikes. A gender breakdown is included as a potential modifier. Also, there are two methods for users of this service. Some subscribe to the service, while others pay by the ride.
