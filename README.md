# NYC Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview
This analysis uses data from one month of rides with a bikesharing service in New York City to provide insight which may be helpful in the design of a similar service in another location. The focus is on when and for how long users tend to use the bikes. A gender breakdown is included as a potential modifier. Also, there are two methods for users of this service. Some subscribe to the service, while others pay by the ride.

![Day of the week, by gender and user type](NYC_Bikesharing7.png)
Subscribers tend to ride more on weekdays (except Wednesday), though still with high numbers of rides on weekends. Customers with individual rides were comparatively evenly spread throughout the week, though there were more rides on the weekends. Patterns are the same in both male and female riders. Riders with unknown gender were much more likely to be customers rather than subscribers, and to have weekend rides.
